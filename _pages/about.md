Hi! I’m currently a Ph.D. student in the [Information Sciences and Technology (IST)](https://ist.psu.edu/) at [Penn State University](https://www.psu.edu/), where I am advised by [Dr.Justin Silverman](http://www.justin-silverman.com/). My research interest is to develop statistical and machine learning models for complex data, particular in Bayesian parametric and nonparametric methods for time-series analysis of genomic and microbiome data. My recent work focuses on causal estimation in the presence of model misspecification and unmeasured confounding.

Before pursuing my Ph.D., I worked as a statistician at the [FDA](https://www.fda.gov/) in the [Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER)](https://www.fda.gov/about-fda/fda-organization/center-drug-evaluation-and-research-cder). I also earned a concurrent master’s degree in [Applied Statistics](https://science.psu.edu/stat) and [International Affair](https://www.sia.psu.edu/?gad_source=1&gclid=Cj0KCQjw05i4BhDiARIsAB_2wfDjO5Ev4dxJL54viuCDbtVTWMmB0VLi_kqm-X8mSmYCraoTRvrpqQIaAi4TEALw_wcB) from Penn State, and a bachelor’s degree in Business from Peizheng College.


**Key Words:** Generalized Gaussian Process Regression, Conformal Prediction, Causal Inference, Count Compositional Data, Microbiome Data, Time Series Analysis
