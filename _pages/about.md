Hi! I’m currently a Ph.D. student in the [Information Sciences and Technology (IST)](https://ist.psu.edu/) at [Penn State University](https://www.psu.edu/), where I am advised by [Dr.Justin Silverman](http://www.justin-silverman.com/). My research focuses on developing machine learning algorithms and statistical tools to
advance the understanding and application of biomedical (e.g., microbiome, genomics)
and social science data. I recently developed a Bayesian additive Gaussian Process for
modeling compositional data, enabling the analysis of how various factors drive changes
in microbial and genomic communities. Additionally, I am interested in integrating
causal inference and conformal prediction to improve causal estimation and uncertainty
quantification in these fields.




Before pursuing my Ph.D., I worked as a statistician at the [FDA](https://www.fda.gov/) in the [Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER)](https://www.fda.gov/about-fda/fda-organization/center-drug-evaluation-and-research-cder). I earned a concurrent master’s degree in Applied Statistic and International Affair from Penn State, along with a bachelor’s degree in Business from Peizheng College.
